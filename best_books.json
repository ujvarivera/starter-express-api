Volume 14 (of 27) by AL CAPP (Softcover) The most popular of Capp's hundreds of distinctive characters was the Shmoo. This lovable little creature loved mankind so much that it would sacrifice itself and turn into a ham steak, a gallon of milk or a dozen eggs: whatever its owner desired. Its whiskers made nice toothpicks and its eyes could be recycled as buttons. Most important, a Shmoo could reproduce faster than a rabbit. Thus, if you had one Shmoo, you were set. You didn't need to work at all. Thus did the apparent book for mankind become its curse and the powers that be decreed that all Shmoos must be exterminated. Capp's insightful morality tale was so popular that it spawned an unprecedented merchandising bonanza. Two introductions, by David Schreiner and by science fiction writer Harlan Ellison, are illustrated with various Shmoo toys manufactured. The large back cover photograph shows a selection of Shmoo merchandise in color from the Denis Kitchen collection. Also featured in this volume: Flying Sausages (parody of \"Flying Saucers,\" a term first coined a few months earlier; Fearless Fosdick, Nightmare Alice, Salomey, Adam Lazonga, Moonbeam McSwine, Cousin Weak-Eyes and Marryin' Sam.

Narrated in a mixture of biblical rhetoric, black dialect, and colloquial English, Hurston traces Moses' life from the day he Is launched into the Nile river in a reed basket, to his development as a great magician, to his transformation into the heroic rebel leader, the Great Emancipator. From his dramatic confrontations with Pharaoh to his fragile negotiations with the wary Hebrews, this very human story is told with great humor, passion, and psychological insight--the hallmarks of Hurston as a writer and champion of black culture.","language":"English","isbn":9780060919948,"genres":"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'African American', 'Classics', 'African American Literature', 'Religion', 'Womens', 'Race', 'School', 'Literature']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":310,"publisher":"Harpperen","publishDate":"Published","firstPublishDate":"January 1st 1939","awards":"[]","numRatings":1200,"ratingsByStars":"['393', '442', '300', '55', '10']","likedPercent":95,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387734776l/84030.jpg","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":11.38},{"bookId":"11684163-kuba-rozpruwacz","title":"Kuba Rozpruwacz","series":"","author":"Paul Begg","rating":3.74,"description":"Do dziś nie wiadomo, kto stał za zbrodniami przypisywanymi Kubie Rozpruwaczowi, mordercy prostytutek z londyńskiego East Endu końca epoki wiktoriańskiej.

And it's a story that's been believed ever since. Too bad it just isn't true.Jonathan Lopez has done what no other writer could--tracking down primary sources in four countries and five languages to tell for the first time the real story of the world's most famous forger. Neither unappreciated artist nor antifascist hero, Van Meegeren emerges in The Man Who Made Vermeers as an ingenious, dyed-in-the-wool crook--a talented Mr. Ripley armed with a paintbrush, who worked virtually his entire adult life making and selling fake Old Masters. Drawing upon extensive interviews with descendents of Van Meegeren's partners in crime, Lopez also explores the networks of illicit commerce that operated across Europe between the wars. Not only was Van Meegeren a key player in that high-stakes game during the 1920s, landing fakes with powerful dealers and famous collectors such as Andrew Mellon (including two pseudo-Vermeers that Mellon donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.), but the forger and his associates later offered a case study in wartime opportunism as they cashed in on the Nazi occupation.The Man Who Made Vermeers is a long-overdue unvarnishing of Van Meegeren's legend and a deliciously detailed story of deceit in the art world.","language":"English","isbn":9780151013418,"genres":"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Art History', 'Biography', 'True Crime', 'Crime', 'Historical', 'World War II', 'Biography Memoir']","characters":"['Han van Meegeren', 'Johannes Vermeer', 'Hermann Göring', 'Joseph Duveen']","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":340,"publisher":"Harcourt, Inc.","publishDate":"September 8th 2008","firstPublishDate":"July 28th 2008","awards":"['Edgar Award Nominee for Best Fact Crime (2009)', 'Marfield Prize (National Award for Arts Writing) Nominee (2008)']","numRatings":8359,"ratingsByStars":"['3058', '2071', '1921', '820', '489']","likedPercent":84,"setting":"['Netherlands']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328834298l/3359595.jpg","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":5.47},{"bookId":"17203883-culloo","title":"Culloo","series":"","author":"Murielle Cyr (Goodreads Author)","rating":4.41,"description":"TALA can't wait to be thirteen; then no one better tell her what to do.

It was a crucial friendship, and a unique one--a president and a prime minister spending enormous amounts of time together (113 days during the war) and exchanging nearly two thousand messages. Amid cocktails, cigarettes, and cigars, they met, often secretly, in places as far-flung as Washington, Hyde Park, Casablanca, and Teheran, talking to each other of war, politics, the burden of command, their health, their wives, and their children.Born in the nineteenth century and molders of the twentieth and twenty-first, Roosevelt and Churchill had much in common. Sons of the elite, students of history, politicians of the first rank, they savored power. In their own time both men were underestimated, dismissed as arrogant, and faced skeptics and haters in their own nations--yet both magnificently rose to the central challenges of the twentieth century. Theirs was a kind of love story, with an emotional Churchill courting an elusive Roosevelt. The British prime minister, who rallied his nation in its darkest hour, standing alone against Adolf Hitler, was always somewhat insecure about his place in FDR's affections--which was the way Roosevelt wanted it. A man of secrets, FDR liked to keep people off balance, including his wife, Eleanor, his White House aides--and Winston Churchill.Confronting tyranny and terror, Roosevelt and Churchill built a victorious alliance amid cataclysmic events and occasionally conflicting interests. Franklin and Winston is also the story of their marriages and their families, two clans caught up in the most sweeping global conflict in history.Meacham's new sources--including unpublished letters of FDR's great secret love, Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd, the papers of Pamela Churchill Harriman, and interviews with the few surviving people who were in FDR and Churchill's joint company--shed fresh light on the characters of both men as he engagingly chronicles the hours in which they decided the course of the struggle.Hitler brought them together; later in the war, they drifted apart, but even in the autumn of their alliance, the pull of affection was always there. Charting the personal drama behind the discussions of strategy and statecraft, Meacham has written the definitive account of the most remarkable friendship of the modern age.","language":"English","isbn":9780812972825,"genres":"['History', 'Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Presidents', 'World War II', 'Politics', 'American History', 'War', 'Historical', 'Biography Memoir']","characters":"['Franklin D.

John Sutherland is perfectly suited to the task. He has researched, taught, and written on virtually every area of literature, and his infectious passion for books and reading has defined his own life. Now he guides young readers and the grown-ups in their lives on an entertaining journey 'through the wardrobe' to a greater awareness of how literature from across the world can transport us and help us to make sense of what it means to be human. Sutherland introduces great classics in his own irresistible way, enlivening his offerings with humor as well as learning: Beowulf, Shakespeare, Don Quixote, the Romantics, Dickens, Moby Dick, The Waste Land, Woolf, 1984, and dozens of others. He adds to these a less-expected, personal selection of authors and works, including literature usually considered well below 'serious attention' - from the rude jests of Anglo-Saxon runes to The Da Vinci Code. With masterful digressions into various themes - censorship, narrative tricks, self-publishing, taste, creativity, and madness - Sutherland demonstrates the full depth and intrigue of reading. For younger readers, he offers a proper introduction to literature, promising to interest as much as instruct. For more experienced readers, he promises just the same.","language":"English","isbn":9780300186857,"genres":"['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Literature', 'Books About Books', 'Literary Criticism', 'Reference', 'Writing', 'Historical', 'Language', 'English Literature']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":288,"publisher":"Yale University Press","publishDate":"November 5th 2013","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":1277,"ratingsByStars":"['355', '544', '290', '72', '16']","likedPercent":93,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366555209l/17802957.jpg","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":6.69},{"bookId":"542604.Phaze_Doubt","title":"Phaze Doubt","series":"Apprentice Adept #7","author":"Piers Anthony","rating":3.82,"description":"The merged worlds of Phaze and Proton face a new threat from an invading force--leaving the fate of the two planets in the hands of Nepe/Flach and Lysander, two children possessing magical powers.","language":"English","isbn":9780441662630,"genres":"['Fantasy', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Young Adult', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Adventure', 'Adult', 'Unicorns']","characters":"['Nepe/Flach, Lysander']","bookFormat":"Mass Market Paperback","edition":"","pages":324,"publisher":"Ace Books","publishDate":"January 1st 1991","firstPublishDate":1990,"awards":"[]","numRatings":4699,"ratingsByStars":"['1344', '1594', '1386', '305', '70']","likedPercent":92,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309288098l/542604.jpg","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":3.21},{"bookId":"25063218-die-sch-nsten-erz-hlungen-1","title":"Die Schönsten Erzählungen 1","series":"","author":"Jeremias Gotthelf","rating":5,"description":"","language":"German","isbn":9999999999999,"genres":"[]","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"","edition":"","pages":335,"publisher":"Weltbil","publishDate":"Published","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":1,"ratingsByStars":"[]","likedPercent":"","setting":"[]","coverImg":"","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":""},{"bookId":"11364074-tremble","title":"Tremble","series":"Celestra #2","author":"Addison Moore (Goodreads Author)","rating":4.03,"description":"Sixteen year-old, Skyla Messenger is determined to bring back the dead.For Skyla, being an angel from the coveted Celestra faction hasn't been easy.

Within a hundred years both of these kingdoms had been thrown into chaos by the onslaught of the Vikings and within two hundred years they had become distant memories.This book charts the transformation of the political landscape of northern Britain between the eighth and the eleventh centuries. Central to this narrative is the mysterious disappearance of the Picts and their language and the sudden rise to prominence of the Gaelic-speaking Scots who would replace them as the rulers of the North. From Pictland to Alba uses fragmentary sources which survive from this darkest period in Scottish history to guide the reader past the pitfalls which beset the unwary traveller in these dangerous times.

D. Gardner finds himself under the care of Dr. James Boozer. Fresh out of medical school, Dr. Boozer is eager to try the new talking cure for insanity, and encourages his elderly patient to reminisce about his experiences as the first black attorney to practice law in nineteenth-century West Virginia. Gardner's most memorable case was the one in which he helped to defend a white man on trial for the murder of his young bride—a case that the prosecution based on the testimony of a ghost.  Greenbrier, West Virginia, 1897 Beautiful, willful Zona Heaster has always lived in the mountains of West Virginia. Despite her mother’s misgivings, Zona marries Erasmus Trout Shue, the handsome blacksmith who has recently come to Greenbrier County. After weeks of silence from the newlyweds, riders come to the Heasters’ place to tell them that Zona has died from a fall, attributed to a recent illness. Mary Jane is determined to get justice for her daughter. A month after the funeral, she informs the county prosecutor that Zona’s ghost appeared to her, saying that she had been murdered. An autopsy, ordered by the reluctant prosecutor, confirms her claim.  The Greenbrier Ghost is renowned in American folklore, but Sharyn McCrumb is the first author to look beneath the legend to unearth the facts. Using a century of genealogical material and other historical documents, McCrumb reveals new information about the story and brings to life the personalities in the trial: the prosecutor, a former Confederate cavalryman; the defense attorney, a pro-Union bridgeburner, who nevertheless had owned slaves; and the mother of the murdered woman, who doggedly sticks to her ghost story—all seen through the eyes of a young black lawyer on the cusp of a new century, with his own tragedies yet to come.  With its unique blend of masterful research and mesmerizing folklore, illuminating the story’s fascinating and complex characters, The Unquiet Grave confirms Sharyn McCrumb’s place among the finest Southern writers at work today.","language":"English","isbn":9781476772875,"genres":"['Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'True Crime', 'Horror', 'Crime', 'Historical Mystery', 'Ghosts', 'Ghost Stories']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Kindle Edition","edition":"","pages":369,"publisher":"Atria Books","publishDate":"September 12th 2017","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":2154,"ratingsByStars":"['424', '882', '679', '139', '30']","likedPercent":92,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1487139683l/33834730.jpg","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":5.39},{"bookId":"311151.The_Quiet_Gentleman","title":"The Quiet Gentleman","series":"","author":"Georgette Heyer, Karen Hawkins (Goodreads Author) (Foreword)","rating":3.96,"description":"Gervase Frant finally returns to his father's estate to claim his title as the new Seventh Earl of St. Erth at Stanyon.

Gervase struggles to maintain a gentlemanly balance, but now the brothers are again rivals as they bid for the lady's attentions. But the dangers of the Lincolnshire countryside could never be more unexpected. Gervase finds himself the victim of repeatedly life-threatening accidents. And soon it becomes increasingly clear that someone wants the new Earl cruelly dead. Level-headed Drusilla Morville is captivated by Gervase but knows that she does not stand a chance against the debutantes vying for his affections, until Gervase's life is endangered and free-spirited Drusilla comes to the rescue.","language":"English","isbn":9780373836840,"genres":"['Romance', 'Historical Fiction', 'Regency', 'Historical Romance', 'Historical', 'Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Regency Romance', 'Classics', 'British Literature']","characters":"['Gervase Frant, Earl of St Erth', 'Drusilla Morville']","bookFormat":"Mass Market Paperback","edition":"Harlequin Signature Showcase","pages":416,"publisher":"Harlequin","publishDate":"January 10th 2006","firstPublishDate":1951,"awards":"[]","numRatings":7277,"ratingsByStars":"['2326', '2794', '1784', '318', '55']","likedPercent":95,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1217460707l/311151.jpg","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":8.34},{"bookId":"287490.Memoirs_of_My_Nervous_Illness","title":"Memoirs of My Nervous Illness","series":"","author":"Daniel Paul Schreber, Richard A.

It became clear to Schreber that his personal crisis was implicated in what he called a \"crisis in God's realm,\" one that had transformed the rest of humanity into a race of fantasms.

From the seed first planted by slave dances held in Congo Square and nurtured by early ensembles led by Buddy Belden and Joe \"King\" Oliver, jazz began its long winding odyssey across America and around the world, giving flower to a thousand different forms--swing, bebop, cool jazz, jazz-rock fusion--and a thousand great musicians. Now, in The History of Jazz, Ted Gioia tells the story of this music as it has never been told before, in a book that brilliantly portrays the legendary jazz players, the breakthrough styles, and the world in which it evolved. Here are the giants of jazz and the great moments of jazz history--Jelly Roll Morton (\"the world's greatest hot tune writer\"), Louis Armstrong (whose O-keh recordings of the mid-1920s still stand as the most significant body of work that jazz has produced), Duke Ellington at the Cotton Club, cool jazz greats such as Gerry Mulligan, Stan Getz, and Lester Young, Charlie Parker's surgical precision of attack, Miles Davis's 1955 performance at the Newport Jazz Festival, Ornette Coleman's experiments with atonality, Pat Metheny's visionary extension of jazz-rock fusion, the contemporary sounds of Wynton Marsalis, and the post-modernists of the Knitting Factory. Gioia provides the reader with lively portraits of these and many other great musicians, intertwined with vibrant commentary on the music they created. Gioia also evokes the many worlds of jazz, taking the reader to the swamp lands of the Mississippi Delta, the bawdy houses of New Orleans, the rent parties of Harlem, the speakeasies of Chicago during the Jazz Age, the after hours spots of corrupt Kansas city, the Cotton Club, the Savoy, and the other locales where the history of jazz was made. And as he traces the spread of this protean form, Gioia provides much insight into the social context in which the music was born. He shows for instance how the development of technology helped promote the growth of jazz--how ragtime blossomed hand-in-hand with the spread of parlor and player pianos, and how jazz rode the growing popularity of the record industry in the 1920s. We also discover how bebop grew out of the racial unrest of the 1940s and '50s, when black players, no longer content with being \"entertainers,\" wanted to be recognized as practitioners of a serious musical form. Jazz is a chameleon art, delighting us with the ease and rapidity with which it changes colors. Now, in Ted Gioia's The History of Jazz, we have at last a book that captures all these colors on one glorious palate. Knowledgeable, vibrant, and comprehensive, it is among the small group of books that can truly be called classics of jazz literature.","language":"English","isbn":9780195126532,"genres":"['Music', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Jazz', 'Art', 'Cultural', 'Reference', 'Criticism', 'American History', 'The United States Of America']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":471,"publisher":"Oxford University Press","publishDate":"May 6th 1998","firstPublishDate":"November 1st 1997","awards":"[]","numRatings":3770,"ratingsByStars":"['1511', '1347', '634', '169', '109']","likedPercent":93,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348549243l/177539.jpg","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":5.2},{"bookId":"24105713-the-reluctant-duchess","title":"The Reluctant Duchess","series":"Ladies of the Manor #2","author":"Roseanna M.

This work, from the woodblocks of collaborator Hans Lützelburger, was first published in book form in 1538.The theme of the dance of death was a popular one of the sixteenth century. Holbein captured the feeling of death, the leveler, in its attack on all classes, both sexes, and all ages. A stylized skeleton seizes the child from his mother's breast. The skeleton snatches, plays, tugs, and cavorts throughout the rest of the book. The king, emperor, pope, and cardinal must cease from their functions. The skull is thrust into the face of the astrologer. The hourglass runs out onto the floor. Countess, nun, sailor, peddler, senator are all stopped by the common force. Forty-one finely cut, highly detailed woodcuts capture the single motif, Memento mori: \"Remember, you will die.\" Although the theme is common, the variety of expressions, social groups, backgrounds, styles of dress and architecture, and calls to death are so varied that each one is unique in its power.This edition, reprinting the unabridged 1538 edition, is the first in a series reprinting great rare books from the Rosenwald Collection. Besides the woodcuts, the book contains a prefatory letter by Jean de Vauzéle and various quotations, depictions, and meditations on death, deaths of men, and the necessity of death. A repeated series of the 41 woodblocks follows the reprinted work and contains English translations of the quotations and verses. Art historians and social historians will find this to be one of the best depictions of class life caught at its fateful moment. The collector will find this to be the finest reproduction of one of Holbein's major works.","language":"English","isbn":9780486228044,"genres":"['Art', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Classics', 'Art History', 'Art and Photography', 'Horror', 'European History']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":160,"publisher":"Dover Publications","publishDate":"June 1st 1971","firstPublishDate":1538,"awards":"[]","numRatings":201,"ratingsByStars":"['93', '82', '22', '3', '1']","likedPercent":98,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415677873l/955496.jpg","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":9.03},{"bookId":"11100829-worst-impressions","title":"Worst Impressions","series":"","author":"K.L.

While the skeptical use of criteria to fashion a Jesus contrary to the one portrayed in the Gospels is methodologically unsound and theologically unacceptable, these criteria, properly formulated and applied, yield positive results that support the Gospel accounts and the historical narrative in Acts. This book presents a nuanced and vitally needed alternative to the skeptical extremes of revisionist Jesus scholarship that, on the one hand, uses historical methods to call into question the Jesus of the Gospels and, on the other, denies the possibility of using historical methods to learn about Jesus.","language":"","isbn":9780310534761,"genres":"['New Testament', 'Christian']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":384,"publisher":"Zondervan Academic","publishDate":"October 8th 2019","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":12,"ratingsByStars":"['5', '5', '2', '0', '0']","likedPercent":100,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553357025l/44441891.jpg","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":21.11},{"bookId":"1152410.Return_to_Wild_America","title":"Return to Wild America: A Yearlong Search for the Continent's Natural Soul","series":"","author":"Scott Weidensaul","rating":4.07,"description":"In 1953, birding guru Roger Tory Peterson and noted British naturalist James Fisher set out on what became a legendary journey-a one hundred day trek over 30,000 miles around North America. They traveled from Newfoundland to Florida, deep into the heart of Mexico, through the Southwest, the Pacific Northwest, and into Alaska's Pribilof Islands. Two years later, Wild America, their classic account of the trip, was published.On the eve of that book's fiftieth anniversary, naturalist Scott Weidensaul retraces Peterson and Fisher's steps to tell the story of wild America today. How has the continent's natural landscape changed over the past fifty years? How have the wildlife, the rivers, and the rugged, untouched terrain fared? The journey takes Weidensaul to the coastal communities of Newfoundland, where he examines the devastating impact of the Atlantic cod fishery's collapse on the ecosystem; to Florida, where he charts the virtual extinction of the great wading bird colonies that Peterson and Fisher once documented; to the Mexican tropics of Xilitla, which have become a growing center of ecotourism since Fisher and Peterson's exposition. And perhaps most surprising of all, Weidensaul finds that much of what Peterson and Fisher discovered remains untouched by the industrial developments of the last fifty years. Poised to become a classic in its own right, Return to Wild America is a sweeping survey of the natural soul of North America today.","language":"English","isbn":9780865476882,"genres":"['Nature', 'Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Birds', 'Natural History', 'Biology', 'Animals', 'Outdoors', 'Science', 'Ecology']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":416,"publisher":"North Point Press","publishDate":"November 9th 2005","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":178,"ratingsByStars":"['65', '70', '36', '5', '2']","likedPercent":96,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316638072l/1152410.jpg","bbeScore":7,"bbeVotes":1,"price":5.2},{"bookId":"42052148-pythen","title":"Pythen","series":"Galactic Order #1","author":"Erin Raegan (Goodreads Author)","rating":4.08,"description":"PeytonI was having a cold coffee with my best friend Vivian when the whole world went upside down.Now there are gazelle-glowing-like-a-light-bulb aliens running around eating everybody, and enormous dark purply colored aliens that have a strong resemblance to bats, dive bombing from the sky.

Leary’s controversial views made him a public enemy in the United States, where he was eventually arrested in 1970 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. His escape from prison, and subsequent flight, with the help of the Weathermen, first to Algeria, then to Switzerland, Vienna, Beirut, and finally Kabul, Afghanistan, read like something out of a novel. Other events in Leary’s life were no less dramatic, and he chronicles them in this book openly and energetically. Intriguing cameos of iconic figures are woven into the author’s life history, including one by Cary Grant, whose experiments with lysergic acid are described in detail. Ultimately, Timothy Leary’s memories are as much a record of a singular era in American history as they are one man’s recollections of a struggle against persecution and being ostracized.","language":"English","isbn":9780874778700,"genres":"['Biography', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'History', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'Memoir', 'Politics', 'Philosophy', 'Science']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":407,"publisher":"Tarcher","publishDate":"March 17th 1997","firstPublishDate":1983,"awards":"[]","numRatings":654,"ratingsByStars":"['263', '235', '122', '22', '12']","likedPercent":95,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171046059l/83491.jpg","bbeScore":6,"bbeVotes":1,"price":16.3},{"bookId":"254395.Just_Checking","title":"Just Checking: Scenes From the Life of an Obsessive-Compulsive","series":"","author":"Emily Colas","rating":3.54,"description":"We all worry. We all have moments of unfounded dread (Is someone behind that door?), or little phobias (roaches) or superstitions (step on a crack) that we indulge. Just Checking is an autobiographical account of what it is like to live with a full-blown case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which, at its height, finds author Emily Colas nervous that she will contract a disease from blood that she sees on television. In the course of the book, what at first appear to her husband and friends to be Colas's idiosyncratic notions accumulate until she is frozen by the astounding psychological binds of OCD. Using precise (of course), connect-the-dots scenes, Colas draws a life that is at first highly monitored and ultimately unraveled by her disorder. One imagines that from afar, Colas's behavior at the height of her illness would look incomprehensible and just plain weird: She has to check the dishwasher multiple times before using it to make sure the cat is safe; the packaging of every new toothbrush has to meet rigorous sanitary standards; the landlord can't attempt to find new tenants for her apartment  she won't let them in the house. But readers are not at a distance here. Instead, we become privy to Colas's somewhat apologetic but firm explanations of what her logic was, and what it felt like to be afraid. She is so honest and witty that one can't help liking her, rooting for her, and wishing help would come. In a typical vignette, when the family tries to go to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade (\"definitely a mistake\"), Colas is terrified that shewillstep on blood: When I was a kid in New York, all we had to eat on the street were pretzels and hot dogs. Food that was readily identifiable. Now, vendors sell the fanciest things with cherries, berries, jelly, and other crap that's way too close to the color of blood. We finally made it to where we had to go, but not before I had inspected the bottom of my shoes. There was a mushy red object there. Maybe a cherry, possibly a finger. The kids watched the parade on TV and I had a nice new worry. My kids don't even remember that lovely November day, but, lucky for me, I do. This event is sad and resonant, but it also manages to be viscerally entertaining. The result is that instead of inspiring schadenfreude, this book reminds us that psychological disorders are often exaggerations of the ordinary and familiar. We all, on a continuum, wish to survive, to avoid disease, to impose order on our lives. We sympathize with Colas's desperate attempts to find safety and with her seemingly loving husband's gradual loss of tolerance. Even the not-so-funny poems that are occasionally interspersed among the perfectly crafted chapterettes find their place. Strange as it may be to find charm in a memoir of illness, Colas is utterly winning. \n  Hilary Liftin is a writer living in New York City. Her first book, coauthored with Kate Montgomery, is scheduled for publication by Vintage next year.

THE REAL HISTORY? It’s a story of how regular people banded together and, armed with little more than their brains and good aim, defeated a mighty foe.Not long ago the streets of New York City were smelly, smoggy, sooty, and loud. There were so many trucks making deliveries that it might take an hour for a car to travel a few blocks. People blamed the truck owners and the truck owners blamed the little wooden pushcarts that traveled the city selling everything from flowers to hot dogs. Behind closed doors the truck owners declared war on the pushcart peddlers. Carts were smashed from Chinatown to Chelsea. The peddlers didn’t have money or the mayor on their side, but that didn’t stop them from fighting back. They used pea shooters to blow tacks into the tires of trucks, they outwitted the police, and they marched right up to the grilles of those giant trucks and dared them to drive down their streets. Today, thanks to the ingenuity of the pushcart peddlers, the streets belong to the people—and to the pushcarts.The Pushcart War was first published more than fifty years ago. It has inspired generations of children and been adapted for television, radio, and the stage around the world. It was included on School Library Journal’s list of One Hundred Books That Shaped the Twentieth Century, and its assertion that a committed group of men and women can prevail against a powerful force is as relevant in the twenty-first century as it was in 1964.","language":"English","isbn":9780440471479,"genres":"['Fiction', 'Childrens', 'Young Adult', 'Historical Fiction', 'Middle Grade', 'Humor', 'Classics', 'New York', 'Juvenile', 'Chapter Books']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":224,"publisher":"Dell Yearling","publishDate":"May 1st 1987","firstPublishDate":1964,"awards":"['Lewis Carroll Shelf Award', \"Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children's Book Award Nominee (1966)\"]","numRatings":4124,"ratingsByStars":"['1810', '1427', '689', '145', '53']","likedPercent":95,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320559465l/219557.jpg","bbeScore":6,"bbeVotes":1,"price":3.87},{"bookId":"123673.A_Case_of_Conscience","title":"A Case of Conscience","series":"After Such Knowledge #4","author":"James Blish, Greg Bear (Introduction)","rating":3.65,"description":"Father Ruiz-Sanchez is a dedicated man--a priest who is also a scientist, and a scientist who is also a human being.

Our health care is staggeringly expensive, yet one in six Americans has no health insurance. We have some of the most skilled physicians in the world, yet one hundred thousand patients die each year from medical errors. In this gripping, eye-opening book, award-winning journalist Shannon Brownlee takes readers inside the hospital to dismantle some of our most venerated myths about American medicine. Using vivid examples of real patients and physicians, Overtreated debunks the idea that most of medicine is based in sound science, and shows how our health care system delivers huge amounts of unnecessary care that is not only expensive and wasteful but can actually imperil the health of patients.The interests of politicians and the medical-industrial complex continually trump those of patients, seducing the wealthy with unnecessary procedures and leaving the poor with haphazard access to treatment. Backward economic incentives allow patients with chronic conditions to receive ineffective care, and roll after roll of red tape undermines even the best-intentioned doctors. Tens of thousands of patients die each year from overtreatment. American medicine is in desperate need of fixing.Nevertheless, Overtreated ultimately conveys a message of hope by reframing the debate over health care reform. Americans worry about rationing--that any effort to rein in the high cost of health care will result in limited access to life-saving treatments. Covering the uninsured seems like an insurmountable problem because it will drive up costs even more. Overtreated offers a way to control costs and cover the uninsured, while simultaneously improving the quality of American medicine. Shannon Brownlee's humane, intelligent, and penetrating analysis empowers readers to avoid the perils of overtreatment, as well as pointing the way to better health care for everyone.","language":"English","isbn":9781582345802,"genres":"['Nonfiction', 'Health', 'Medicine', 'Medical', 'Health Care', 'Science', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'History', 'Social Issues']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":343,"publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing PLC","publishDate":"September 18th 2007","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":908,"ratingsByStars":"['322', '351', '180', '40', '15']","likedPercent":94,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1431397952l/469778.jpg","bbeScore":6,"bbeVotes":1,"price":5.2},{"bookId":"433435._","title":"چهل سالگی","series":"","author":"ناهید طباطبایی, Nahid Tabatabaee","rating":2.88,"description":"داستانهای فارسی","language":"Persian","isbn":9789645571663,"genres":"['Novels', 'Fiction', 'Short Stories']","characters":"['آلاله', 'فرهاد', 'شقایق', 'هرمز شادان', 'خانم شیرازی', 'ساناز ثقفی']","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":90,"publisher":"نشر چشمه","publishDate":"August 21st 2010","firstPublishDate":2000,"awards":"[]","numRatings":582,"ratingsByStars":"['55', '105', '210', '142', '70']","likedPercent":64,"setting":"['Tehran (Iran)']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432843652l/433435.jpg","bbeScore":6,"bbeVotes":1,"price":101.48},{"bookId":"22725532-bronagh","title":"Bronagh","series":"Slater Brothers #1.5","author":"L.A.

When she takes up with a cocksure new companion, Agostino, feeling ignored and unloved, begins hanging around with a group of local young toughs. Though repelled by their squalor and brutality, and repeatedly humiliated for his weakness and ignorance when it comes to women and sex, the boy is increasingly, masochistically drawn to the gang and its rough games. He finds himself unable to make sense of his troubled feelings. Hoping to be full of manly calm, he is instead beset by guilty curiosity and an urgent desire to sever, at any cost, the thread of troubled sensuality that binds him to his mother. Alberto Moravia’s classic, startling portrait of innocence lost was written in 1942 but rejected by Fascist censors and not published until 1944, when it became a best seller and secured the author the first literary prize of his career. Revived here in a new translation by Michael F. Moore, Agostino is poised to captivate a twenty-first-century audience.","language":"English","isbn":9781590177235,"genres":"['Fiction', 'Italian Literature', 'Italy', 'Classics', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Coming Of Age', '20th Century', 'Novella', 'Travel']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":111,"publisher":"NYRB Classics","publishDate":"July 8th 2014","firstPublishDate":1945,"awards":"[]","numRatings":1888,"ratingsByStars":"['253', '686', '661', '226', '62']","likedPercent":85,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1520459427l/18666080._SY475_.jpg","bbeScore":6,"bbeVotes":1,"price":14.86},{"bookId":"3032006-la-est-tica-musical-desde-la-antig-edad-hasta-el-siglo-xx","title":"La estética musical desde la Antigüedad hasta el siglo XX","series":"","author":"Enrico Fubini","rating":4.86,"description":"Planteado como un recorrido cronologico desde los poemas homericos hasta las ultimas tendencias contemporaneas, el presente libro examina todos aquellos temas en los que la filosofia o el pensamiento se imbrican con la creacion musical.

It provoked a vast number of imitations and remained steadily in print through the eighteenth century (with sporadic reprints after that). It still possesses an enormous vigor and vitality.The book owes its long life to an imagination, wit, and humor rich with insights into human nature, yet neither bitter nor namby pamby. Its commentary on the boasting, pedantry, false learning, gambling, gluttony, medical folly, adultery, greed, envy, hatred, pride and other failings that mark humanity are sharp and telling, and, sadly, as relevant today as they were 450 years ago.This translation by Professor Edwin H. Zeydel is the only accurate English translation ever published. (Barclay's version is really a pastiche written in imitation of Brant.) The form Professor Zeydel uses is verse, like the original, and he even retains the original rhyme scheme and meter. The achievement is remarkable, for it captures all the charm and movement of the original German while sacrificing nothing to readability and fluidity.Published now with the 114 original Renaissance woodcuts and with Professor Zeydel's annotations, a biography of Brant, a publishing history, and a survey of the work's influence, this will unquestionably remain the definitive edition of The Ship of Fools in English.

But the booty he's just captured on a merchant ship is a fierce tempered minx who claims to be a bride...his bride, married to him by proxy on behest of their fathers.

Ramachandran, now shares his unique insight into human consciousness in an entertaining, inspiring, and intellectually dazzling brief tour of the ultimate frontier—the thoughts in our heads.A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness is made up of five investigations of the greatest mysteries of the brain. The first chapter shows how amputees feel pain in limbs they no longer have as it introduces the great revolution of our age: neuroscience. The second chapter walks through the way what we see determines our thoughts, and demonstrates the counterintuitive point that believing is in fact seeing. The third chapter takes a leap beyond cutting edge science to audaciously set out a general theory of beauty, explaining why, the world over, cultures have fundamentally similar notions of what is attractive. The fourth chapter explores the bizarre world of synesthetes, people who see colors in numbers, textures in smells, sounds in sights, and flavors in sounds. Finally, V. S. Ramachandran one of the foremost brain researchers in the world today, sums up the implications of the revolution in our understanding of consciousness, to make a fascinating argument about our essential sense of self and its distributed nature.","language":"English","isbn":9780131872783,"genres":"['Science', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Neuroscience', 'Philosophy', 'Brain', 'Popular Science', 'Medicine', 'Biology', 'Medical']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":208,"publisher":"Plume","publishDate":"July 26th 2005","firstPublishDate":"December 4th 2003","awards":"[]","numRatings":3516,"ratingsByStars":"['1411', '1124', '682', '212', '87']","likedPercent":91,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432093693l/31554._SY475_.jpg","bbeScore":5,"bbeVotes":1,"price":3.84},{"bookId":"145249.Beyond_the_Sky_and_the_Earth","title":"Beyond the Sky and the Earth: A Journey Into Bhutan","series":"","author":"Jamie Zeppa","rating":4.16,"description":"At age 24 Jamie Zeppa, a Canadian who had never been outside of North America, said goodbye to her fiancé and her plans for graduate school and moved to Bhutan, a remote Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas. Beyond the Sky and the Earth is an autobiographical work that details her experiences and transformations after spending three years in Bhutan. It is as much a book about Zeppa's day-to-day life in Bhutan as it is about the personal awakenings and realizations that she had while living there. Visitors to Bhutan, an increasingly hot tourist destination, are still few and far between, largely because of tight government restrictions on entry, visa requirements, and a law requiring tourists to spend at least $200 a day there. There aren't many books on Bhutan, and even fewer first-hand accounts of life there. Beyond the Sky and the Earth stands out as both an informative introduction to the people and culture of Bhutan and as a beautiful piece of travel literature set against the backdrop of one of the most remote and unspoiled places on earth. Zeppa recounts her experiences living abroad, such as learning to live without electricity and carrying on a forbidden affair with one of her students, in such a compelling way that even someone who has never left home will become entranced by her story and captivated by her unique experiences. Naturally, Zeppa experienced culture shock when she arrived in Bhutan. The hardships she encountered seemed insurmountable, and at first she thought she couldn't bear it and fantasized about returning to Canada. She had to learn a new language in order to communicate with her students, she had to learn to live on her own, and she had to learn to deal with homesickness. Perhaps her biggest challenge was learning how to reconcile her growing love for Bhutan with her nostalgia for her life in Canada, her family, and her fiancé. But after living among Bhutan's Himalayan peaks, lush valleys, colorful villages, and friendly people, and after gaining an appreciation for life in a place frozen in time, Zeppa realizes that she feels at home in Bhutan and wants to stay.Although to Zeppa Bhutan is a magical land, she cautions herself and the reader not to deem it \"the last Shangri-La,\" as is often done by the lucky travelers who make their way through the red tape required for entry into the kingdom. Bhutan is not without its problems: it is an underdeveloped country plagued by the problems that affect many places cut off from modernity. There is infant mortality, illness, and poverty. There are also domestic and international tensions that stem from the government's stringent regulations intended to preserve the national culture. Among them are the prohibition of foreign television and a requirement that people wear the national dress, a kira for women and a gho for men.Few of us will ever get to see the place that was Zeppa's home. But her narrative is so clear and insightful that you easily feel as though you are sharing this portion of her life with her. Even if you haven't had the experience of living abroad, or if the prospect of a trip to the furthest reaches of Asia is not in your cards, Zeppa's book is a worthy read on many levels. From her powerful use of language to describe the superb beauty of Bhutan's landscape to her passionate description of her spellbinding relationship with her future husband, Beyond the Sky and the Earth draws readers in and takes them on her rocky ride to self-realization. When trying to explain to a friend what she finds appealing about Bhutan, Zeppa writes: \"It takes a long time to find the true words, to put them in order, to tell the whole story. It is not just this or that, the mountains, the people, it is me and the way I can be here, the freedom to walk unafraid into the great dark night. It is a hundred thousand things and I could never trace or tell all the connections and reflections, the shadows and echoes and secret relations between them.\"But, in fact, Zeppa does tell the reader about these connections and reflections in a lyrical way. After reading the book, you will have a deep understanding, appreciation, and respect for Zeppa's strength of character and for the wonders of Bhutan.Beyond the Sky and the Earth is a delight to read in every way. Zeppa's beautiful prose, peppered alternately with funny observations and profound soul-searching, is a truly special and unique work that will leave you craving an adventure of your own.","language":"English","isbn":9781573228152,"genres":"['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Memoir', 'Asia', 'Biography', 'Adventure', 'Biography Memoir', 'Cultural', 'Autobiography', 'Canada']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":303,"publisher":"Riverhead Books","publishDate":"May 1st 2000","firstPublishDate":"May 18th 1999","awards":"[]","numRatings":3440,"ratingsByStars":"['1396', '1370', '529', '105', '40']","likedPercent":96,"setting":"['Bhutan']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309283944l/145249.jpg","bbeScore":5,"bbeVotes":1,"price":5.2},{"bookId":"689929.The_Valley_of_Adventure","title":"The Valley of Adventure","series":"Adventure #3","author":"Enid Blyton","rating":4.19,"description":"Nothing could be more exciting than a night flight on Bill’s plane!

Using strong, even strident, colors, applied in a manner deriving from Cezanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh, the Fauves took painting back to its basic principles, inspired by primitive art, popular prints and children's paintings, and paved the way to Cubism.

The company also sent along a new employee to guard its treasure. He was Jeronimus Corneliszoon, a disgraced and bankrupt man with great charisma and dangerously heretical ideas. With the help of a few disgruntled sailors, he hatched a plot to seize the ship and her riches. The mutiny might have succeeded, but in the dark morning hours of June 3, 1629, the Batavia smashed through a coral reef and ran aground on a small chain of islands near Australia. The captain and skipper escaped the wreck, and in a tiny lifeboat they set sail for Java—some 1,500 miles north—to summon help. More than 250 frightened survivors waded ashore, thankful to be alive. Unfortunately, Jeronimus and the mutineers had survived too, and the nightmare was only beginning.","language":"English","isbn":9780609807163,"genres":"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'True Crime', 'Adventure', 'Australia', 'Maritime', 'Historical', 'Biography', 'Survival', 'Crime']","characters":"['Jeronimus Corneliszoon']","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":512,"publisher":"Broadway Books","publishDate":"May 27th 2003","firstPublishDate":"February 12th 2002","awards":"[]","numRatings":2841,"ratingsByStars":"['1101', '1170', '457', '86', '27']","likedPercent":96,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320528804l/128824.jpg","bbeScore":5,"bbeVotes":1,"price":5.42},{"bookId":"826542.The_Love_Machine","title":"The Love Machine","series":"","author":"Jacqueline Susann","rating":3.73,"description":"A blockbuster tale from the 1960s--available again after an absence of 15 years--\"The Love Machine\" tells the story of TV-network titan Robin Stone, \"around whom women flutter like so many moths . . . and his rise and fall as he makes the international sex scene, drinks unlimited quantities, and checks out the latest Nielsens\" (Newsweek).","language":"English","isbn":9780802135445,"genres":"['Fiction', 'Romance', 'Chick Lit', 'Drama', 'Classics', 'Adult Fiction', 'Womens Fiction', 'Novels', 'Contemporary', '20th Century']","characters":"['Robin Stone', 'Amanda (the fashion model)', 'Maggie Stewart', 'Judith Austin', 'Gregory Austin', 'Danton Miller', 'Christie Lane', 'Ethel Evans', 'Sergio', 'Kitty Stone', 'Lisa Stone', 'Ike Ryan', 'Dip Nelson', 'Alfie Knight', 'Cliff Dorne', 'Jerry Moss', 'Andy Parino', 'Dr. Archie Gold']","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":511,"publisher":"Grove Press","publishDate":"December 14th 1997","firstPublishDate":"January 1st 1969","awards":"[]","numRatings":2730,"ratingsByStars":"['741', '870', '816', '242', '61']","likedPercent":89,"setting":"['New York City, New York (United States)']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348349452l/826542.jpg","bbeScore":5,"bbeVotes":1,"price":6.46},{"bookId":"13516050-king-city","title":"King City","series":"King City","author":"Brandon Graham","rating":4.04,"description":"Joe is a catmaster, trained to use his cat as any tool or weapon.

Described by the author as “a book about real male comradeship,” the novel follows the unemployed narrator and his friends, Jewish anti-Semite Dogg Pavlov and Vasia the Communist, on their adventures around Kharkiv and beyond.  Against a background of social disintegration, slowly eroding Soviet mores and rapidly encroaching Western culture, the three comrades drink gratuitous amounts of vodka and embark on a quest to find their missing friend Sasha Carburetor to tell him about the suicide of his one-legged stepfather. Despite containing some darker themes, Depeche Mode takes an irreverent look at life; Zhadan is not afraid to mix philosophical musings and grotesque narrative with moments of slapstick comedy.  Serhiy Zhadan is one of the key voices in contemporary Ukrainian literature: his poetry and novels have enjoyed popularity at home and abroad. His poetic style and masterful wordplay have led critics to dub his trademark approach “verbal jazz”, a description that reflects his unique authorial voice. Zhadan stands as a witness to a time of great social change through the eyes of Ukraine’s dispossessed youth. His work explores the changes he has witnessed as a representative of the immediate post-Soviet generation in Ukraine. Never one to bow to convention, since giving up university teaching in 2004 Zhadan was involved in 2006’s Orange Revolution. Writing is just one of his many interests, which also include singing in a band, translating poetry and organising literary festivals.","language":"English","isbn":9788389755513,"genres":"['Fiction', 'Ukraine', 'Ukrainian Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Poetry', 'Modern', 'Russia']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Kindle Edition","edition":"","pages":202,"publisher":"Glagoslav Publications","publishDate":"May 6th 2014","firstPublishDate":2004,"awards":"[]","numRatings":960,"ratingsByStars":"['317', '362', '203', '54', '24']","likedPercent":92,"setting":"['Kharkiv (Ukraine)']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451019593l/28322296._SY475_.jpg","bbeScore":5,"bbeVotes":1,"price":""},{"bookId":"704176.The_Gobsmacking_Galaxy","title":"The Gobsmacking Galaxy","series":"The Knowledge","author":"Kjartan Poskitt, Daniel Postgate (Illustrator)","rating":4.01,"description":"First there was the Big Bang.

Each book is now being released separately. This revised edition of The Scorpion's Mate has some small changes from the original.\n  Claire has never really fit in with everyone around her, but she's carved out a life for herself using her own unique style and artistic ability to support herself on the Internet. The last thing she expects is to be abducted by aliens and dropped into a research facility, where a genetically-engineered alien soldier chooses her as his life-mate.\n  Thrax’s pheromones are compelling, and his status as a fellow unwilling test subject makes them allies, but Claire isn't certain she can trust someone who is convinced she belongs to him, when all she wants to do is find a way to return home to Earth - a place that her devoted alien can never follow, because there’s no way the scorpion-like alien would ever be able to pass for human.\n  Still, she’ll accept help where she can find it, so she doesn't hesitate to escape with Thrax from the facility, though their time running from their pursuers in the warrens beneath the research facility will forever change Claire, and could make it impossible for her to return to Earth.\n  But will there be anywhere else in the galaxy they can go where their love will be accepted?\n  Author's Note: 18+ only, this book contains scenes of graphic intimacy and violence that are not intended for younger readers.

(How is it, he asks, that living creatures perform some cognitive tasks so swiftly and easily, where computers do them only badly or not at all?)

Proud, complex, strong-willed, witty, and cunning, Borzu successfully led his people on their annual migrations for many years. He regulated their travel; mediated conflicts; intervened in (and sometimes exacerbated) tense situations between his people and other nomads; and dealt with the government police agency. Structuring the account around the four seasons, Lois Beck recounts the day-to-day activities of Borzu during the year she spent traveling with his people. She describes the rigors of nomadic life and the consequences of decisions made in haste.During 1970 to 1971, Borzu and his people were faced with many difficulties. When the expected winter rains did not fall, pastures and crops shriveled. Unable to sell their starving livestock for any profit, Borzu's people saw their debts to urban merchants and moneylenders increase. At the same time, Iran exercised more bureaucratic control over the Qashqa'i by applying new policies over migratory schedules and the allocation of scarce pastures, and by introducing non-Qashqa'i agriculturalists and livestock investors as legitimate land users. All these measures threatened the nomad's way of life and eventually undermined the role of headmen such as Borzu. Lois Beck details the vicissitudes endured by Borzu's people and the strategies he devised to cope with them.Blending ethnographic and historical material, this book contains information unavailable for other tribal and nomadic pastoral groups in the Middle East and central Asia. Through Beck's deft analysis, we come to understand why nomadic pastoralism was once an important part of this vast region, and why tribal society has endured.","language":"English","isbn":9780520070035,"genres":"[]","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":482,"publisher":"University of California Press","publishDate":"December 19th 1991","firstPublishDate":"November 19th 1991","awards":"[]","numRatings":8,"ratingsByStars":"['1', '2', '2', '3', '0']","likedPercent":62,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1266806336l/2417663.jpg","bbeScore":4,"bbeVotes":1,"price":22.82},{"bookId":"1586116.Endless_Universe","title":"Endless Universe","series":"","author":"Marion Zimmer Bradley","rating":3.69,"description":"From the back cover:Planets are for leaving.That's an old saying in the Explorers.

His writings on moral quandaries reflect a lifelong devotion to music and performance, and, as a counterpoint, he wrote on music aesthetics and on modernist composers such as Faur�, Debussy, and Ravel. Music and the Ineffable brings together these two threads, the philosophical and the musical, as an extraordinary quintessence of his thought. Jank�l�vitch deals with classical issues in the philosophy of music, including metaphysics and ontology. These are a point of departure for a sustained examination and dismantling of the idea of musical hermeneutics in its conventional sense.Music, Jank�l�vitch argues, is not a hieroglyph, not a language or sign system; nor does it express emotions, depict landscapes or cultures, or narrate. On the other hand, music cannot be imprisoned within the icy, morbid notion of pure structure or autonomous discourse. Yet if musical works are not a cipher awaiting the decoder, music is nonetheless entwined with human experience, and with the physical, material reality of music in performance. Music is \"ineffable,\" as Jank�l�vitch puts it, because it cannot be pinned down, and has a capacity to engender limitless resonance in several domains. Jank�l�vitch's singular work on music was central to such figures as Roland Barthes and Catherine Cl�ment, and the complex textures and rhythms of his lyrical prose sound a unique note, until recently seldom heard outside the francophone world.","language":"English","isbn":9780691090474,"genres":"['Music', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":171,"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publishDate":"July 28th 2003","firstPublishDate":1961,"awards":"[]","numRatings":51,"ratingsByStars":"['24', '19', '5', '2', '1']","likedPercent":94,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1372040852l/538926.jpg","bbeScore":4,"bbeVotes":1,"price":32.72},{"bookId":"12715291-for-love-of-a-horse","title":"For Love of a Horse","series":"Jinny #1","author":"Patricia Leitch","rating":4.29,"description":"Jinny saw the accident.

Doctor’s causes over 800,000 deaths and millions of life-threatening complications each year. Or, as Harvard Professor Lucian Leape testified before Congress, it’s equivalent to six jumbo jets falling out of the sky every day!Whether it is from taking the billions of prescriptions for medications for high blood pressure or high cholesterol, for arthritis or insomnia, for depression or ADHD or the thousands of unnecessary surgeries taking place every day in hospitals throughout the country, readers will be presented with the horrifying facts to awaken them from the nightmare of todays prevailing medical system and be encouraged to discover alternatives. Research reveals how over 63 % of these deaths and injuries from the medical system were found to be preventable and over 75 % of the conditions patients were being treated for could be cured without medication or surgery!Dr. Sheen has been a healthcare professional for the past thirty years and has worked with hospitals, Health Departments, schools, wellness task forces and thousands of individuals in communities worldwide. He observed firsthand how the dependency of society upon a money driven sick-care system has caused great harm and dependency upon toxic medications and dangerous medical interventions. In his book he shares how this dependency begins at birth and is systematically impressed upon every person through every stage of life. Is it any wonder those 65 and above fill an average of 15 prescriptions per year, and this number rises with their age!As Dr Sheen shares “After fifty years of involvement in health and wellness, it is clear to me that each person MUST play an active role in maintaining their optimal functioning as a human being, physically, emotionally and mentally. We need to have the most up-to-date information available about our minds and bodies, which we must actively assert to protect our overall health. It is not about trusting or mistrusting the medical establishment, but it is being aware that sick-care is a business with rules and regulations which often prove to be more to their advantage than to ours. We each need to understand the realities of the pressures those in the medical profession have and the near-impossible task of continually staying at the cutting-edge of the many diverse disciplines of medicine, science and technology and become an active and informed participant in maintaining our health and avoiding dangerous medical interventions.”Dr Sheen’s companion book, The Epigenetic Cure; Re-educating Your Cells and DNA for Optimal Health then shares a wide variety of successful non toxic and life sustaining alternative scientific approaches.","language":"","isbn":"B0884LBWG2","genres":"[]","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Kindle Edition","edition":"","pages":139,"publisher":"Quantum Embodiment Publications; 1 edition","publishDate":"May 4th 2020","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":2,"ratingsByStars":"[]","likedPercent":"","setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1592212844l/54063308._SY475_.jpg","bbeScore":4,"bbeVotes":1,"price":""},{"bookId":"889071.Mother_of_God","title":"Mother of God","series":"","author":"David Ambrose","rating":3.3,"description":"Tessa Lambert sits in a hotel room, alone and afraid.

It elevated the natural sciences to the preeminent position they enjoy in modern culture. It inaugurated a skepticism toward tradition and authority that decisively shaped modern attitudes in religion, morality, and politics. And it gave birth to a vision of history that saw man, through the unfettered use of his own reason, at last escaping that state of “immaturity” to which superstition, prejudice, and dogma had condemned him. The world in which we live is, for better or worse, in large part the result of the Enlightenment. This course will explore this remarkable period. It will discuss the work of such influential thinkers as Voltaire, John Locke, Denis Diderot, Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant, and Benjamin Franklin. It will also spend some time with less well-known, but no less influential, figures such as Joseph Priestly—a clergyman, scientist, and philosopher who was one of the most passionate defenders of the American Revolution in England—and the remarkable John Toland, a man whose writings on religion changed the way many Europeans thought about the Scriptures. The Enlightenment involved more than simply books and ideas. To understand the Enlightenment we need to look not just at what people wrote but also at how they lived. During the eighteenth century, they began to congregate in coffeehouses, where they read newspapers, discussed politics, and created something known as “public opinion.” Others of them began to meet in societies that were dedicated to the advancement of the sciences and there they explored how science might be put to work improving society. Still others began to meet in strange new secret societies—for example, the Masonic lodges that spread across Europe—where they attempted to put the ideals of equality and brotherhood into practice. From the start, the Enlightenment has been controversial. In its own day, some argued that it threatened to undermine the moral and religious foundations on which society rested. It has not ceased to be controversial. In our day, some have charged that many of the maladies of modern societies can be traced to its shallow rationalism. This course offers a more balanced assessment of the Enlightenment, considering both its achievements and its shortcomings and focusing not only on its most important intellectual achievements but also on the strange and often colorful characters who populated it. - From the Publisher","language":"English","isbn":9781419337154,"genres":"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Audiobook', 'Philosophy']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Audiobook","edition":"","pages":8,"publisher":"Prince Frederick, MD, [Boulder, Colo Recorded Books","publishDate":2007,"firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":46,"ratingsByStars":"['8', '12', '20', '3', '3']","likedPercent":87,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1269415182l/4691109.jpg","bbeScore":3,"bbeVotes":1,"price":""},{"bookId":"16163857-cloud-walking","title":"Cloud Walking","series":"Find You in the Dark #1.5","author":"A.

But as violence ravages the world, the end never seems in sight. All Lucy can do is wait and tend to her victory garden while her mother does her part at the ammunition factory in town. That is until the Department of Defense appears on her doorstep telling her she could end the fighting if she’ll join The Cypress Project. When Joshua O’Donnell’s father packs him off to Yale, forbidding him to enlist, he hopes his son’s brains will keep him off the battlefield. But Joshua’s knack for quantum mechanics draws attentions from his professor, a genius in the field of experimental science, who is working on technology that could end World War Two. Promised a nonviolent end to the war effort, Joshua can hardly say no to helping The Cypress Project. The war has made Howard Patton an even richer man. Son of railroad tycoon Randolph Patton, Howard was a millionaire before he was born, but with a war on, trains are more important than ever. It’s good business and Howard isn’t eager to see it end until the government approaches him with a proposal: fund the technology that could end the war and receive power beyond his imagination. But when Howard discovers the true nature of The Cypress Project, he realizes his real remuneration is the one thing that his money can’t buy. Completing The Cypress Project will force them all to make choices between love, destiny and freedom, but as the secrets of the experiment are revealed, each must decide between the bloody war being waged on the world’s soil and a deception that could change the course of humanity.","language":"English","isbn":9999999999999,"genres":"['Dystopia', 'Young Adult', 'Short Stories', 'Science Fiction', 'Fiction']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"","edition":"","pages":60,"publisher":"","publishDate":2013,"firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":102,"ratingsByStars":"['25', '30', '31', '13', '3']","likedPercent":84,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383601296l/18753174.jpg","bbeScore":3,"bbeVotes":1,"price":""},{"bookId":"125257.The_Quest_for_Consciousness","title":"The Quest for Consciousness: A Neurobiological Approach","series":"","author":"Christof Koch","rating":4.12,"description":"About the AuthorBorn in 1956 in the American Midwest, Christof Koch grew up in Holland, Germany, Canada, and Morocco, where he graduated from the Lycée Descartes in 1974.

They were three generations under one roof. Three generations, but only one branch of a scraggy tree; they are a war-haunted family in a war-torn century. Having survived the trenches of World War I as an Austro-Hungarian conscript, Vinich journeyed to America and built a life for his family. His daughter married the Hungarian-born Bexhet Konar, who enlisted to fight with the Americans in the Second World War but brought disgrace on the family when he was imprisoned for desertion. He returned home to Pennsylvania a hollow man, only to be killed in a hunting accident on the family’s land. Finally, in 1971, Hannah’s prodigal younger son, Sam, was reported MIA in Vietnam.And so there is only Bo, a quiet man full of conviction, a proud work ethic, and a firstborn’s sense of duty. He is left to grieve but also to hope for reunion, to create a new life, to embrace the land and work its soil through the seasons. The Signal Flame is a stirring novel about generations of men and women and the events that define them, brothers who take different paths, the old European values yielding to new world ways, and the convalescence of memory and war.Beginning shortly after Easter in 1972 and ending on Christmas Eve this ambitious novel beautifully evokes ordinary time, a period of living and working while waiting and watching and expecting. The Signal Flame is gorgeously written, honoring the cycles of earth and body, humming with blood and passion, and it confirms Andrew Krivak as a writer of extraordinary vision and power.","language":"","isbn":9781501126376,"genres":"['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'War', 'Literary Fiction', 'Family', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Adult Fiction', 'Americana', 'American']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Kindle Edition","edition":"","pages":288,"publisher":"Scribner","publishDate":"January 24th 2017","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":765,"ratingsByStars":"['225', '346', '152', '34', '8']","likedPercent":95,"setting":"['Pennsylvania (United States)']","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469305668l/31204695._SY475_.jpg","bbeScore":3,"bbeVotes":1,"price":3.87},{"bookId":"17410200-an-amateur-peasant-girl","title":"An Amateur Peasant Girl","series":"","author":"Alexander Pushkin","rating":4.18,"description":"Baryshnya-krestyanka","language":"","isbn":9999999999999,"genres":"['Classics', 'Russia', 'Short Stories', 'Russian Literature', 'Romance', 'School', 'Fiction', 'Literature']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"","edition":"","pages":43,"publisher":"Rodale Press","publishDate":1955,"firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":411,"ratingsByStars":"['196', '123', '66', '20', '6']","likedPercent":94,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441260488l/17410200.jpg","bbeScore":3,"bbeVotes":1,"price":""},{"bookId":"16075260-diccionario-de-m-sica-mitolog-a-magia-y-religi-n","title":"Diccionario de música, mitología, magia y religión","series":"","author":"Ramón Andrés","rating":4.38,"description":"En este diccionario sin precedentes, Ramón Andrés, poeta, ensayista y a la vez reputado estudioso de la música, nos acerca al análisis de la naturaleza y los sonidos, así como a la interpretación de los símbolos que en ellos se contienen, al nexo de unión que la música establece entre los dioses y los hombres, que constituye, al cabo, una detallada muestra de la evolución del pensamiento humano.

Half-man, half-god, musician, magician, theologian, poet and lover, his story never leaves us. He may be myth, but his lyre still sounds, entrancing everything that hears it: animals, trees, water, stones, and men.In this extraordinary work Ann Wroe goes in search of Orpheus, from the forests where he walked and the mountains where he worshipped to the artefacts, texts and philosophies built up round him. She traces the man, and the power he represents, through the myriad versions of a fantastical life: his birth in Thrace, his studies in Egypt, his voyage with the Argonauts to fetch the Golden Fleece, his love for Eurydice and journey to Hades, and his terrible death. We see him tantalising Cicero and Plato, and breathing new music into Gluck and Monteverdi; occupying the mind of Jung and the surreal dreams of Cocteau; scandalising the Fathers of the early Church, and filling Rilke with poems like a whirlwind. He emerges as not simply another mythical figure but the force of creation itself, singing the song of light out of darkness and life out of death.","language":"English","isbn":9780224091367,"genres":"['Nonfiction', 'Mythology', 'History', 'Music', 'Poetry', 'Classics', 'Biography', 'Religion', 'Classical Studies', 'Retellings']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":272,"publisher":"Jonathan Cape","publishDate":"July 14th 2011","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"['John D.

A summer when his new friend Roland, seemingly descended from the knights of the past, encouraged him to stand up for himself and for those he loves. It was a summer when he and his friends formed the Order of the Red Dragon that gave them a sense of identity and purpose in their turbulent world; a summer when innocent childhood games were torn apart by an almost inevitable tragedy. Benjamin Dove is a brilliantly conceived work of fiction, tinged with both light and dark humor. Disturbing themes are explored, from bullying to child abuse to rivalry, yet there is always a sense of a child's unbreakable spirit. Published to acclaim in 1992, Benjamin Dove has won several book awards, including the International Board on Books for Young People Award (the IBBY), The Icelandic Children's Book Award, and the Reykjavik City Children's Book Award. It has also been made into a feature length film of the same name, that went on to win awards at eight international film festivals.

Gates back to the Library are malfunctioning across a multitude of worlds, creating general havoc. She and Kai are tasked with a mission to St Petersburg's Winter Palace, to retrieve a book which will help restore order. However, such plans rarely survive first contact with the enemy - particularly when the enemy is the traitor Alberich. A nightmare figure bent on the Library's destruction, Alberich gives Irene a tainted 'join me or die' job offer. Meanwhile, Irene's old friend Vale has been damaged by exposure to Chaotic forces and she has no idea how to save him. When another figure from her past appears, begging for help, Irene has to take a good hard look at her priorities. And of course try to save the Library from absolute annihilation. Saving herself would be a bonus.Irene's adventures feature stolen books, secret agents and forbidden societies - think Doctor Who but with librarian spies!","language":"English","isbn":9781447256274,"genres":"['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Steampunk', 'Mystery', 'Urban Fantasy', 'Dragons', 'Magic', 'Books About Books', 'Adventure', 'Adult']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":358,"publisher":"Pan","publishDate":"December 15th 2016","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":12808,"ratingsByStars":"['3819', '6123', '2572', '262', '32']","likedPercent":98,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1456508529l/29345916._SY475_.jpg","bbeScore":2,"bbeVotes":1,"price":3.58},{"bookId":"297194.Requiem_Edition_Bilingue","title":"Requiem Edition Bilingue","series":"","author":"Anna Akhmatova, Paul Valet (Translator)","rating":4.32,"description":"Ces poèmes qui forment le Requiem et dont on lira ici la traduction, s'échelonnent entre les années 1930 et 1957.

Even Christians have a hard time stomaching such a thought, and many avoid reading those difficult Old Testament passages that make us squeamish. Instead, we quickly jump to the enemy-loving, forgiving Jesus of the New Testament. And yet, the question doesn't go away. Did God really command genocide? Is the command to \"utterly destroy\" morally unjustifiable? Is it literal? Are the issues more complex and nuanced than we realize?In the tradition of his popular Is God a Moral Monster?, Paul Copan teams up with Matthew Flannagan to tackle some of the most confusing and uncomfortable passages of Scripture. Together they help the Christian and nonbeliever alike understand the biblical, theological, philosophical, and ethical implications of Old Testament warfare passages. Pastors, youth pastors, campus ministers, apologetics readers, and laypeople will find that this book both enlightens and equips them for serious discussion of troubling spiritual questions.","language":"","isbn":9780801016226,"genres":"['Theology', 'Christian', 'Religion', 'Christianity', 'Faith', 'Philosophy', 'Old Testament', 'Nonfiction']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":352,"publisher":"Baker Books","publishDate":"November 18th 2014","firstPublishDate":"October 21st 2014","awards":"[]","numRatings":114,"ratingsByStars":"['47', '47', '13', '7', '0']","likedPercent":94,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407710407l/20665259.jpg","bbeScore":2,"bbeVotes":1,"price":17.37},{"bookId":"16131048-thinking-in-numbers","title":"Thinking In Numbers: On Life, Love, Meaning, and Math","series":"","author":"Daniel Tammet (Goodreads Author)","rating":3.53,"description":"A stunning rumination on math and numbers from the bestselling author of Born on a Blue Day.Thinking In Numbers is the book that Daniel Tammet, bestselling author and mathematical savant, was born to write.

He regarded theology as the \"handmaiden\" of knowledge and believed that through reason, people could attain a greater knowledge of God. \"By doubting,\" he declared, \"we come to inquire, and by inquiry we arrive at truth.\" Abélard's tendency to leave questions open for discussion made him a target for frequent charges of heresy, and all his works were eventually included in the church's Index of Forbidden Books.

This book is a beautiful anthology of Scott?s favorite images, accompanied by his insightful commentary.

From the streets of New York to the parks of Florence, from Stockholm to Paris, from London to Moscow and Milan, these are the men and women who have inspired Scott and the many diverse and fashionable readers of his blog.

Most Iraqis were barred from entering the Emerald City for fear they would blow it up. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and internal documents, Chandrasekaran tells the story of the people and ideas that inhabited the Green Zone during the occupation, from the imperial viceroy L. Paul Bremer III to the fleet of twentysomethings hired to implement the idea that Americans could build a Jeffersonian democracy in an embattled Middle Eastern country. In the vacuum of postwar planning, Bremer ignores what Iraqis tell him they want or need and instead pursues irrelevant neoconservative solutions—a flat tax, a sell-off of Iraqi government assets, and an end to food rationing. His underlings spend their days drawing up pie-in-the-sky policies, among them a new traffic code and a law protecting microchip designs, instead of rebuilding looted buildings and restoring electricity production. His almost comic initiatives anger the locals and help fuel the insurgency. Chandrasekaran details Bernard Kerik’s ludicrous attempt to train the Iraqi police and brings to light lesser known but typical travesties: the case of the twenty-four-year-old who had never worked in finance put in charge of reestablishing Baghdad’s stock exchange; a contractor with no previous experience paid millions to guard a closed airport; a State Department employee forced to bribe Americans to enlist their help in preventing Iraqi weapons scientists from defecting to Iran; Americans willing to serve in Iraq screened by White House officials for their views on Roe v. Wade; people with prior expertise in the Middle East excluded in favor of lesser-qualified Republican Party loyalists. Finally, he describes Bremer’s ignominious departure in 2004, fleeing secretly in a helicopter two days ahead of schedule. This is a startling portrait of an Oz-like place where a vital aspect of our government’s folly in Iraq played out. It is a book certain to be talked about for years to come.","language":"English","isbn":9781400044870,"genres":"['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Journalism', 'Military History', 'American History', 'Audiobook', 'American']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Hardcover","edition":"","pages":320,"publisher":"Knopf","publishDate":"September 19th 2006","firstPublishDate":2006,"awards":"['Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2007)', 'Ridenhour Book Prize (2007)', 'Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction (2007)', 'Cornelius Ryan Award (2006)', 'National Book Award Finalist for Nonfiction (2006)']","numRatings":5666,"ratingsByStars":"['1812', '2500', '1096', '211', '47']","likedPercent":95,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388184155l/22121.jpg","bbeScore":1,"bbeVotes":1,"price":3.59},{"bookId":"4565266-modlitwa-o-deszcz","title":"Modlitwa o deszcz","series":"Terra incognita","author":"Wojciech Jagielski","rating":4.33,"description":"Modlitwa o deszcz jest owocem jedenastu podróży Wojciecha Jagielskiego do Afganistanu, odbytych między wiosną 1992 roku a jesienią roku 2001.

Its impact on the Palm Beach community is detailed.Few societal happenings have commanded the interest generated by the 1985 visit of Princess Diana and Prince Charles to Palm Beach. Some still regard it as \"the social event of the Century.\" The fame and power of those in attendance attest to this designation. They included Gregory Peck, Bob Hope, Ted Turner, Armand Hammer, Victor Borge, Cary Grant, Merv Griffin, Malcolm Forbes, Abigail Van Buren (\"Dear Abby\"), H. Ross Perot, Joan Collins, Eva Gabor, Laurance S. Rockerfeller, Donald Trump and the Sultan of Oman.The author and his wife, then the Mayor of West Palm Beach, actively participated in all aspects of the 1985 visit. The details and related subsequent revelations involving these and other members of the House of Windsor are brilliantly recorded in an authoritative manner.

Based on extensive research amongst both migrants who sell sex and social helpers, Sex at the Margins provides a radical analysis. Frequently, says Agustín, migrants make rational choices to travel and work in the sex industry.

Along the way, it takes the occasional divergent path to discuss some slightly less cataclysmic topics such as galactic colonization, what would happen if the Earth were struck by the comet Swift-Tuttle (a distinct possibility), the effects of falling in a black hole, and how to create a \"baby universe.\" Wonderfully morbid to the core, this is one of the most original science books to come along in years.","language":"English","isbn":9780465038510,"genres":"['Science', 'Physics', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Astronomy', 'Popular Science', 'Space', 'British Literature']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":176,"publisher":"Basic Books","publishDate":"January 9th 1997","firstPublishDate":1994,"awards":"[]","numRatings":920,"ratingsByStars":"['251', '329', '266', '62', '12']","likedPercent":92,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348868421l/797498.jpg","bbeScore":1,"bbeVotes":1,"price":2.53},{"bookId":"2037584.To_Hold_Infinity","title":"To Hold Infinity","series":"","author":"John Meaney","rating":3.73,"description":"Against a seething backdrop of social unrest and corruption, a young woman finds herself in a desperate bid to clear her son's name, a struggle that brings her into direct conflict with a malevolent force.","language":"English","isbn":9780553505887,"genres":"['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Space Opera']","characters":"[]","bookFormat":"Paperback","edition":"","pages":560,"publisher":"Bantam","publishDate":"April 2nd 1998","firstPublishDate":"","awards":"[]","numRatings":141,"ratingsByStars":"['30', '56', '42', '13', '0']","likedPercent":91,"setting":"[]","coverImg":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408925597l/2037584.jpg","bbeScore":1,"bbeVotes":1,"price":2.94},{"bookId":"22925176-sweet-possession","title":"Sweet Possession","series":"Sweet Addiction #2","author":"J.

As Harper gripped the bars of her cage, in the alien prison; it sunk in that she seriously had been kidnapped from Earth, to become the fated consort of some alien prince. This wasn’t some elaborate prank, or government experiment. True to form, Harper pissed off the tyrannical king with her refusal. Now she found herself at the mercy of convicts, locked away and forgotten in the bowels of a mountain. Harper’s gaze fell on a shadowy beast of a man, sitting casually on the rundown catwalk. The imposing man looked like he ruled the prison. He was the color of midnight, and his eyes were that eerie arctic blue, that was nearly colorless. Harper shivered as he regarded her. All Nameless knew was the Hold, with its misery and struggle. He never wanted to keep a female, surviving was hard enough, but that was before the Pink Pearl dropped into his world. Nameless had never seen anything like the stunning exotic little creature. Not only was she the catalyst for strange dreams and revelations about his past, but she made him feel. He had to have her. >Harper wanted free of the alien prison, and she wanted to go home, except Nameless wasn’t prepared or willing to let her go, even if she hated him because of it. He owned every part of her, and bound her to him, in ways that could never be undone, collar or no collar. In her wildest dreams, Harper never imagined the twists destiny could take, or that she would find soul deep satisfaction with such a nameless fate. Follow Harper and Nameless as they struggle to get free of the Hold, and seek their revenge on the despot responsible for putting them there.
